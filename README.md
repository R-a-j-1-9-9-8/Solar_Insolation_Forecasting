# Solar_Insolation_Forecasting

In this project the Solar Insolation value was predicted by two methods: -
1. By using Atmospheric conditions
2. By using past data values

Dataset was downloaded from https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/

Data processing and EDA is shown in solar_exploratory_data_analysis_&_feature_selection notebook.

The first part of project, in which machine learning algorithms were used to predict the insolation value by using atmospheric conditions, is shown in solar_half notebook.

In solar_deep notebook, deep learning architecture (LSTM) is used for forecasting.

In solar_prophet notebook, Prophet model is used for forecastin.
